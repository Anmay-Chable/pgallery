        <p>These past months I have learned how to use Snap. Snap is a program were you can make easy commands and be creative. I made all of my games on snap.Though some were confusing to do, I tried my best and constructed the game.I had fun completing and playing my games, though they aren't perfect I still had fun.The first game  is based on star wars, its one of the games I took my time to make, also one of the most complex. The second game was one of the first game, its more like a little show. I first did it when I started this class.The third game is a simple pong game in space.The fourth game is a guessing game. It ask you questions about shapes, and its sides and in the end the magician tells you what shape you were thinking about. </p>      <!--Reflections about your games-->
